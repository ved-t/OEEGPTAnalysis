# OEEGPTAnalysis

Welcome to OEE analysis by Gemini 2.5 Flash.
Ask for OEE score of devices present in the dataset with filters such as: Device ID, Location, Month, Year and Day of month.

Instruction:
-Download the preoject and install necessary libraries
  --Pandas
  --Google genai
  --Colorama
  --Pydantic

  or just run the requirements.py file and it will install the necessary libraries.

-I have already included a API key, but make sure to change the API key if the rate limits are exhausted.

Thanks!!
